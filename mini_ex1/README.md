## My first independent coding process
In this code I basiclly just drew som shapes and filled them with colors
 
**Setup**

First I had to figure out the coordinate system and learn what the ratio between pixels and the canvas was by setting different sized canvases. I ended up making a canvas sized 500x500, and I ended up liking to work with this size, I'm not really sure why (maybe because it's easy to divide in 2, 4 or 5?)
 
**Draw**

I then tried out the all the different shapes that can be drawn(*ellipse(),traiangle(),arc()*), and startet to want to draw a face (I like drawing cartoony faces). This was a good practise for getting to know what the numbers in the parentheses mean(x,y,w,h).

To give the face more sense of life I figured out how to fill the shapes with color using *fill()*, and leanred how to adjust the RGB variables. And I also learned how to hide the strokes of the shapes using *noStroke()*.
 
I was a little confused by the *background()* setting. I first thought that it should be put under the draw function, but it just made my other shapes dissapear. And then I tried putting the background under the setup function, and then it worked. It was not before the next day I learned (thanks to our dear Shiffman) that the draw function continuesly draws in loops that goes forever, and therefore the background will also be drawn forever.


## Coding vs. reading and writing text
When writing codes you often have an idea of what you wish the program to do, but you never have the perfectly clear picture of what to write. You kind of have to try different things out, like adjusting the numbers or trying a differen function. Just like writing a text, you know what the sentences should say, but it takes a bit time to choose the right words and the right formulations in order to get exactly what you had in mind.
When understanding a code it's important that you read the code from beginning to end and in the correctt order. Unlike reading a text where it is allowed to skip a few words and you'll still get the full meaning out of the text.


## Potential and possibility of coding practice
The next step of this piece of code would be to make it more dynamic. Maybe the eyes could move from side to side, or maybe blink once or twice every now and then? Maybe the mouth could change form from closed to opened?
This piece of code could also be made interactive. Maybe by clicking on the nose a bugger runs down? Maybe by clicking on the mouth a toung sticks out? Maybe by clicking on the skin it changes color?
The possibilities are endless, there could even be sounds involved. Like if the mouth is clicked the face would start talking?
