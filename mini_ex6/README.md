# The program over time - what's been generated
This is a program that generates a bunch of half transparen arcs at random coordinates. These arcs are jiggling/moving randomly and thus creates a dynamic cloud/heatmap effect.
The colors of the arcs can be affected by moving the mouse to the left or right.


Problem:
It moves slower over time??? whyyy?
